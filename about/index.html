    <h2><b>Who We Are</b></h2>
    <p>We are a group of badass women who are here to encourage, support and empower women to ride RAMROD in 2020!
    </p>
    <h2><b>Objective</b></h2>
    <p>
    To encourage, support and empower women to ride RAMROD in 2020 so that 20% of riders are women. This
    means 160 of the 800 riders need to be women.
    While the past three years, the number of women riders has been slowly creeping up, the percentages are
    abysmally low. Below are the numbers from the past 3 years:
</p>
    <ul>
    <li>2019: 131 women or 16.4% of riders (data from post on the RAMROD FB page)</li>
    <li>2018: 122 women or 15.3% of riders (data from post on the RAMROD FB page)</li>
    <li>2017: 114 women or 14.3% of riders (data from post on the RAMROD FB page)</li>
</ul>

    <h2><b>The numbers</b></h2>
    <p>
    Since RAMROD is a lottery of 800 riders, and typically 50% of people who put in for the lottery actually
    get into
    the ride, we need around 320 women to put in for the lottery. In addition to the 320 women, since some
    people
    who win the lottery drop out, weâ€™d need to account for a number of women who win the lottery to cancel.
    RAMROD is put on by the Redmond Cycling Club. Ideally, Redmond Cycling Club would adjust their lottery
    policy to allot a specific number of slots to women to support and improve the number of women who ride,
    however, this is unknown at this time if they will do this. Regardless of the lottery policy, we need
    this club to
    support this initiative and help message this initiative.
