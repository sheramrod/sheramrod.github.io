    <h2><b>Who We Are</b></h2>
    <p>
        We are a group of badass women who are here to encourage, support and empower women to ride RAMROD in 2020!
    </p>

    <h2><b>What is our objective?</b></h2>
    <p>
        The mission of She RAMROD is to encourage, support and empower cis-women, trans-women, 
        and non-binary cyclists to ride RAMROD in 2020 so
        that 20% of riders are women. This means 160 of the 800 riders need to be women.
        While the past three years, the number of women riders has been slowly creeping up, the percentages are
        abysmally low. Below are the numbers from the past 3 years:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>2019: 131 women or 16.4% of riders (data from post on the RAMROD FB page)</li>
        <li>2018: 122 women or 15.3% of riders (data from post on the RAMROD FB page)</li>
        <li>2017: 114 women or 14.3% of riders (data from post on the RAMROD FB page)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>How do we reach 20% in 2020?</b></h2>
    <p>
        <i>Increase Lottery Entries:</i> Since RAMROD is a lottery of 800 riders, and typically 50% of people who put in for the lottery actually
        get into the ride, we need around 320 women to put in for the lottery. In addition to the 320 women, since some
        people who win the lottery drop out, weâ€™d need to account for a number of women who win the lottery to cancel.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Women Supporting Women:</i> She RAMROD aims to build a communiity of women around this ride
        to support each other physically and mentally while we train. We will be organizing training rides,
        clinics, along with sharing information to help you prepare for the ride.
