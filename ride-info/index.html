    <h2><b>So what is RAMROD?</b></h2>
    
    <p>
        RAMROD is a yearly ride organized by Redmond Cycling Club in Redmond, WA where riders cover around 150 miles over about 10,000 feet of 
        elevation in a single day!

    <h2><b>Why pink?</b></h2>
    
    <p>
        Pink seems a bit clich√© right? Well, we thought so too, but while volunteering at RAMROD 2019 and driving around behind the riders, 
        we realized that neon pink is actually the most visible color in any environment. High-vis yellow almost blends in with nature, especially
        on a sunny day!
