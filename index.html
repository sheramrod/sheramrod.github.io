    <h2><b>Welcome to the She RAMROD website!</b></h2>

    <p>
        She RAMROD is an initiative formed to encourage, support, and empower women to Ride 
        Around Mount Rainer in One Day (RAMROD) in 2020 so that 20% of riders are women. Last 
        year only 131 of the 800 riders were women, we want that to change.

    <h2><b>What is RAMROD?</b></h2>

    <p>
        RAMROD is an unforgettable ride in the beautiful Mount Rainer National Park.
        Organized by Redmond Cycling Club, riders cover around 150 miles over about 10,000 
        feet of elevation in a single day. Together She RAMROD riders will train, have fun,
        and crush this crazy awesome ride!
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of it's breathtaking setting, RAMROD is an extremely popular ride. However,
        the National Park service restricts participation to 800 riders. To get a spot to ride, 
        there is a lottery for which registration will open March 1st! We will post the link to register
        when it opens.
