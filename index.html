        She RAMROD is an initiative formed to encourage, support, and empower cis-women, trans-women, and non-binary 
        cyclists to Ride Around Mount Rainer in One Day (RAMROD) in 2020 so that 20% of riders are women. Last 
        year only 131 of the 800 riders were women, we want that to change.
