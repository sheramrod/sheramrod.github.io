    <h1>Build & Maintain your Cycling Base during the Fall & Winter Months</h1>
    <p>WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2020 AT 7 PM PST – 7:45 PM PST</p>
    
        <b>Event description</b><br>
        <p>
            You worked hard during the summer to build a strong cycling base that 
            you don’t want to completely lose as the weather turns cold & rainy and 
            minimizes our cycling outdoors. So how do you plan to be ready to jump back 
            on your bike, feeling confident that you maintained a solid cycling base 
            when the warmer, drier weather starts showing up again? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Join us, as Kari Studley, PT, DPT, shares and discusses with the group how 
            to create a plan to build and maintain your base during the Fall & Winter months.
        </p>
        <p>
        A few questions to ask yourself to prepare for the discussion:
        <ol>
            <li>What are your training goals for 2021?</li>
            <li>How do you plan to keep your cardio during the winter months? Cycling, running, skiing, etc.</li>
            <li>What alternative and complementary activities to cycling would you like to add? e.g. strength training, yoga, etc</li>
            <li>What is your plan for indoor cycling?</li>
            <li>Do you plan to ride outdoors during the Fall and Winter months?</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
