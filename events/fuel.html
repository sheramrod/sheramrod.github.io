        <b>Event description</b><br>
        We are excited to have Coach Sofi Marin join us to discuss fueling for women cyclists. 
        As we add on the mileage in our rides, it is important that we fuel our bodies to 
        keep us strong throughout the many miles. Coach Sofi will discuss overall fueling and 
        hydration and also what women need to consider for fueling when accounting for the 
        menstrual cycle & peri-/meno-pause.
